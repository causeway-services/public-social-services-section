/**
 * @emsenn/organizing - social-scale governing: settling a plurality of agents
 * into one collective.
 *
 * Organizing is the Gen-2 inter-agent lift of @emsenn/animating along the agency
 * spiral. Animating glues three faculty faces into one agent; organizing glues a
 * sheaf of agents into one organization.
 *
 * Carriers should move toward Relating's TypeBox carrier kernel directly. The
 * remaining `*.schema.types.mts` modules are legacy checked-in type surfaces, not
 * a build-time codegen contract. Each verb is one Relating action.
