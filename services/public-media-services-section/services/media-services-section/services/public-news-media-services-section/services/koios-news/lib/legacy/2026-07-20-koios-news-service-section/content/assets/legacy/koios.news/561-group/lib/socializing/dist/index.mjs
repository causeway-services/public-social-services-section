/**
 * @emsenn/socializing — the society reading of agency, admitted through the
 * @emsenn/relating acting boundary and composed over its sibling
 * faculties.
 *
 * socializing WORKS OVER one primary carrier, the Social Field (`socializing/social-field`):
 * its core morphisms transform it (field → field), as communicating's core morphisms transform
 * memes; readings project it into derived carriers. That shape describes the core, it does not
 * define socializing. The Social Field realizes the corpus's
 * MULTI-OBSERVER SYSTEM `V : O → Settlings_B`
 * (content/_archive spatiotemporal-knowledge-presheaf): members are the observers (each
 * an `agent` reused from @emsenn/animating carrying its local `memes` reused from
 * relating); `base` is the OBSERVER CATEGORY `O` (objects = observers, non-identity
 * morphisms = directed translation settling-morphisms `V(α)`, each carrying a reused
 * `channel`); `section` is the consensus LIMIT `lim_O V` (knowledge-meet) with its H¹
 * obstruction.
 *
 * The morphism surface is OFF-DIAGONAL-first. The genuinely social morphisms (among
 * distinct observers) are: admit (grow `O`) and merge (the CRDT `∨_k` exchange) — both
 * SCALE-2-NATIVE, no single-agent analog; translate (the inter-observer perspective map
 * `V(α)`); broadcast (speak↑) and attend (listen↑) — cross-stalk linear transmission;
 * and converge (ground↑) — the consensus limit + H¹ + CALM flag, computed by
 * socializing's own `consensus` module (`sheafCharges`; the corpus's
 * bilattice-network-sheaf-consensus, socializing's domain). The DIAGONAL morphisms are the ten WITHIN-AGENT lifts (communicate,
 * semiose, illocute, negate, conflate, refer, modalize, presuppose, quote, compose)
 * produced by the one reusable `liftStalkwise` primitive from communicating's own
 * exported actions; each restricted to one agent IS the communicating morphism (the
 * diagonal embedding) — so socializing and communicating stay the same arrow read at
 * two scales, while the off-diagonal carries the richer multi-observer structure a
 * stalkwise mirror cannot. The package reuses relating's sheaf/charge algebra,
 * communicating's Channel and meme morphisms, and animating's agent — re-implementing
 * none of them.
