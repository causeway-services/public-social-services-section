 * discipline — a practice as a BEHAVIOUR (frontier register: skills-disciplines-and-the-character-agent).
 *
 * In the 561 corpus a character inhabits working DOMAINS (divining, engineering, performing, governing,
 * …) — its disciplines. On the ludic substrate a discipline is exactly a Girard BEHAVIOUR: the
 * bi-orthogonal closure of its exemplary plays, the magic-circle'd set of plays that COUNT in the
 * practice. A character practices a discipline iff its design lies in that behaviour (it proves the
 * discipline's formula). This is the playing-side reading of the same boundary gaming names with the
 * magic circle and the lusory attitude.
 *
 * Consumes the real `biorthogonalClosure`; re-derives no ludics.
