/**
 * girard — René Girard's MIMETIC SCAPEGOAT mechanism as PATHOLOGICAL CONSENSUS (frontier register §5).
 *
 * Girard's sacrificial crisis is a community dissolved into undifferentiated mimetic rivalry — in the
 * package's terms a field SATURATED with ⊤ (held contradictions everywhere). The scapegoat mechanism
 * resolves it by unanimity-minus-one: the collective converges on a single victim, EXPELS them, and the
 * remainder emerges unanimous and at peace. It is a forced convergence by EXPULSION — a coerced `secede`
 * imposed on one member rather than a chosen withdrawal — and so it is the malign twin of `consensusClose`
 * (consensus reached by sacrifice, not agreement) and the most violent case of recuperation (the crisis's
 * ⊤ discharged onto a body).
 *
 * The detector reads the signature across a before/after pair: high prior contestation, exactly one
 * member removed and removed NOT by their own choice, and posterior unanimity among the remainder.
 *
 * Reuses `contestedCells` (`recuperation.mts`) for the ⊤-saturation reading; re-derives nothing.
