/**
 * settling/valuation-consistency — per-assignment consistency of a valuation.
 *
 * Each assignment's charge is read through the linear-logic charge-consistency
 * judgment (a value is inconsistent exactly when both sides are present —
 * `stable`). The valuation splits into consistent and contradictory
 * subvaluations; the contradiction rank vanishes exactly when no assignment is
 * stable. Contradictions are kept as data, never thrown — the paraconsistent stance.
