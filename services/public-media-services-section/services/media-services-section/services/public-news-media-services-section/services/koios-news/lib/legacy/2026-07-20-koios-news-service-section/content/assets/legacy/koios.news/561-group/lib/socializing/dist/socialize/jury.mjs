/**
 * jury — socializing's EPISTEMIC-DEMOCRACY capabilities: the Condorcet Jury Theorem and Scott Page's
 * Diversity Prediction Theorem. These are the THEOREMS behind the claim `face.mts` already asserts —
 * that a diverse swarm of many ordinary agents beats one strong agent (the saturation-at-~4 reading).
 * Here that assertion is given its formal backbone.
 *
 * Condorcet Jury Theorem (1785): n independent jurors each correct with probability p > ½; the
 * probability the MAJORITY is correct strictly exceeds p and tends to 1 as n → ∞ (and below ½ it
 * tends to 0 — the dark side: a swarm of worse-than-random agents is worse than one). Diversity
 * Prediction Theorem (Page 2007), an EXACT algebraic identity for squared-error estimates:
 *
 *     CrowdError = AverageIndividualError − Diversity
 *
 * the crowd's error equals the average member error minus the prediction diversity — so diversity is
 * not a tax on accuracy, it is a subtraction FROM error. Both are rigorous (no fudge): the CJT a
 * binomial tail, the DPT an exact variance decomposition.
