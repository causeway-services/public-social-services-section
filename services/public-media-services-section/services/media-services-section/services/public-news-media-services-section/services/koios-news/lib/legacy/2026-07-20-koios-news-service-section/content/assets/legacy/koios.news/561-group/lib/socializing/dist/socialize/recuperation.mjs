/**
 * recuperation — the AFFECTIVE-cluster detectors of the californication note (§9, affective battery):
 * the readings that watch DESIRE rather than structure. Kept distinct from the structural cluster
 * (`integrity.mts`) by the note's Proposition 2 — a polity can pass every structural audit and be
 * wholly californicated, so these measure something the structural battery cannot see.
 *
 * The keystone is the SETTLING TRAJECTORY and its best-mathematics reading. The corpus proves the
 * social settling is ≤_k-MONOTONE: a synchronous gossip-merge (∨_k) only ever ACCUMULATES — surfacing
 * disagreement, never resolving it (joining a `potential` with an `active` yields ⊤, and ⊤ is the
 * knowledge-order top, absorbing). So along a NATURAL settling trajectory the contested-cell count is
 * non-decreasing. It follows that ANY DROP in contestation is a violation of settling-monotonicity —
 * it cannot arise from the settling itself, only from an external INTERVENTION on the field. That is
 * exactly recuperation: the anti-monotone move that takes a live ⊤ and returns a managed value. We tell
 * a recuperative discharge (the ⊤ vanished into managed consensus, membership intact) from an organized
 * exit (the ⊤ resolved by fission — a coincident drop in membership, a secession) structurally.
 *
 *   affectiveRecuperationIndex — discharge rate: of the contestation removed along the trajectory, how
 *                                much vanished as managed mood vs how much organized into exit.
 *   recursiveGovernance        — the feedback-containment loop: disturbances absorbed back to quiet by
 *                                discharge rather than by structural change (Result 3, forced convergence).
 *   harmGovernance             — care turned to risk-management: a reparative duty shadowed by a
 *                                surveillance/pre-emptive power over the same offender.
 *
 * Consumes the settling family `settleTrajectory` (`settle.mts`) and relating's bilattice value algebra;
 * re-derives no closure math.
