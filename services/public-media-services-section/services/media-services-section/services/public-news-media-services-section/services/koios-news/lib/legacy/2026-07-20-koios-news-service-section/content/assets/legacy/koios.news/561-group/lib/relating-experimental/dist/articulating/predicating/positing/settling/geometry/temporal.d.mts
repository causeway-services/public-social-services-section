/**
 * settling/geometry/temporal — the causal order of a settling.
 *
 * Time is the settling itself: a cell's temporal position is the stage at which
 * it first fires. Two cells are adjacent when they share a term; causal
 * precedence is the transitive closure of stage-increasing adjacency — a strict
 * partial order (acyclic, since stages strictly increase along every edge).
 * Unrelated cells are spacelike. The ordering fraction (comparable pairs over all
 * pairs) is an exact rational; what dimension it corresponds to is not answered here.
