/**
 * Incarnation â€” the material $|\mathbf{B}|$ of a behaviour (Girard 2001 Â§11).
 *
 * The design note (corpus, ludics/library/design) defines the *design order* â€”
 * "the poset of proper designs on $\xi_0$ ordered by set-inclusion of actions:
 * $\mathfrak{D} \le \mathfrak{D}'$ iff $\mathfrak{D} \subseteq \mathfrak{D}'$"
 * â€” and proves (same note, "Theorem: the design lattice realizes as a
 * sub-lattice of $A_p$") that this inclusion order IS the *knowledge order*
 * $\le_k$ on the predication-fiber: $\mathfrak{D} \le \mathfrak{D}'$ iff
 * $v_\mathfrak{D} \le_k v_{\mathfrak{D}'}$ pointwise.  We reuse meme-algebra's
 * `knowledgeLeq` verbatim for the comparison â€” the design order is not
 * reinvented, it is the apex knowledge order restricted to designs.
 *
 * Girard's **incarnation** $|\mathfrak{D}|_\mathbf{B}$ of a design in a
 * behaviour is the *material* part of $\mathfrak{D}$ â€” the sub-design actually
 * *visited* during plays of $\mathfrak{D}$ against the orthogonal
 * $\mathbf{B}^\perp$.  Loci $\mathfrak{D}$ commits at but that no counter-design
 * in $\mathbf{B}^\perp$ ever meets are inert ballast; the incarnation discards
 * them, keeping the smallest design $\le_k$-below $\mathfrak{D}$ that plays the
 * same against all of $\mathbf{B}^\perp$.  The behaviour note's interaction
 * relation supplies "visited": `interactionReport(d, E).meetings` ranges over
 * exactly the *shared* loci of a play (interaction note, `sharedAndUnionKeys`),
 * so the visited loci of $\mathfrak{D}$ are the union of meeting loci over all
 * $E \in \mathbf{B}^\perp$.
 *
 * The **incarnation of a behaviour** $|\mathbf{B}|$ is the set of incarnated
 * designs â€” the *skeleton*, the material core of the behaviour stripped of
 * ballast.  A design is **material** when it equals its own incarnation (no
 * ballast: every committed locus is visited by some counter-design).  This
 * realizes Girard's slogan that a behaviour is determined by its material
 * designs; the ballast-laden designs are recovered as the $\le_k$-upward closure.
