/**
 * The linear-logic fragment lattice — the poset of $*$-autonomous sub-theories
 * of $\mathbf{CGS}$.
 *
 * Corpus theorem (predication-typed-subtheory-lattice-is-linear-logic-fragment-lattice.md):
 *
 *   $$\mathrm{MLL} \subset \mathrm{MALL} \subset \{\mathrm{ILL}, \mathrm{CLL}\} \subset \mathrm{LL}$$
 *
 * "This lattice is fully classified. Each inclusion is a full $*$-autonomous
 * embedding." The braces are load-bearing: **ILL and CLL are incomparable** —
 * neither $\mathrm{ILL} \le \mathrm{CLL}$ nor $\mathrm{CLL} \le \mathrm{ILL}$.
 * This poset is therefore NOT a chain. We carry the covering relation explicitly
 * and close it reflexively/transitively.
 *
 * Classifying which fragment a proposition lives in: the `Proposition` carrier of
 * this package is CLASSICAL (it has $\parr$ and an involutive `dualProp`), so the
 * connective-subset classifier ranges over the classical chain
 * $\mathrm{MLL} \to \mathrm{MALL} \to \mathrm{CLL} \to \mathrm{LL}$ (the corpus's
 * `⊂` is $*$-autonomous embedding, not connective containment — MLL has $\parr$,
 * which ILL lacks, so MLL ⊄ ILL as connective sets). ILL is represented in the
 * poset for completeness as the intuitionistic sibling (no $\parr$, no $?$) and
 * is documented as not a target of the classical classifier.
