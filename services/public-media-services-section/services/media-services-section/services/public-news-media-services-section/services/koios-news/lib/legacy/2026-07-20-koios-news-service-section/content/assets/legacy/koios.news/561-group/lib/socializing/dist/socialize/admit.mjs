/**
 * socialize/admit — the initial-object inclusion `communicating ↪ socializing`, and
 * one of socializing's two SCALE-2-NATIVE morphisms (a lone agent has no one to be
 * admitted into a society with).
 *
 * admit is endomorphic on the Social Field (field → field): append a new `Member` (an
 * observer — an `agent`, reused from animating, carrying its local `memes`, reused from
 * relating) to `members`, and grow the OBSERVER CATEGORY `O` to connect the new
 * observer to the rest (default: `completeTranslations` over the new observer count —
 * the maximally-connected category, a translation morphism in each direction between
 * every pair). Admitting the FIRST observer is the one-agent society — a DISCRETE `O`
 * with no non-identity translations, exactly communicating's single-agent meme surface,
 * included as the initial object.
 *
 * The admitted agent is built/validated through animating's `agent` constructor (when
 * given a seed) or accepted as an already-built agent carrier; each admitted meme is
 * validated through relating's `isMeme`. The new section is left ungrounded; `converge`
 * (re)computes it.
