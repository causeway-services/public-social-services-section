/**
 * organizing — the social gluing node: organizing's apex.
 *
 * organizing is the social-scale reading of `governing`: the settling of an open
 * plurality of agents into one bounded, law-bearing collective. It is the Gen-2
 * (inter-agent) lift of @emsenn/animating's holographic node — but NOT a mere
 * re-skin of it. The off-diagonal carries structure the diagonal cannot, and this
 * module realizes it:
 *
 *   - The gluing is a CROSS-ARENA Mayer–Vietoris over a cover of constituents
 *     (`crossArena`). On the diagonal the cover is one agent's three faces — they
 *     cannot contest, so they glue coordination-free. Off the diagonal the cover is
 *     MANY agents, so disagreement appears — but by the corpus's cross-arena MV
 *     (cross-arena-mayer-vietoris.md) disagreement-pairs live in ker(δ) and are
 *     TOLERATED (recorded ⊤, adjudicated locally), contributing NO obstruction; the
 *     genuine obstruction is `federationOnly` = coker(diff), content no single
 *     constituent can express. So a society can be glued yet deeply contested.
 *   - `adjudicate` is the gluing act — "the receiving dual of speaking" (the corpus's
 *     act of governing) — which RECEIVES many constituent sections and decomposes
 *     their merge. This is the genuinely off-diagonal act: one agent's own faces have
 *     no adjudication sibling. By Arrow/Gibbard–Satterthwaite (social-choice.md) the
 *     consensus cost it reports can be IRREDUCIBLE — the off-diagonal is the home of
 *     coordination impossibility, which the always-gluing diagonal never meets.
 *   - the four SOCIAL-DESCENT readings mirror animating's four regime readings —
 *     `socialBecoming` → `relating` → `community` → `institution` (the intrinsic
 *     settled order). The organization is the interior bulk; `socialFactor` is the
 *     per-face act-factorization.
 *   - `assemble` makes the spiral concrete: real @emsenn/animating agents re-enter as
 *     the literal constituents of the cross-arena cover.
 *   - `federate` realizes federation = PARALLEL COMPOSITION ‖ (federation-is-parallel-
 *     composition.md): it ‖-composes constituent societies, with shared members as
 *     nominal-set NAME-PASSING (FSym(𝔸)) overlap, and reads the cross-arena MV.
 *
 * The agent base and the descent substrate are reused wholesale from
 * @emsenn/animating; the three faces are threaded, not absorbed. See
 * dev/docs/notes/2026-06-21-animating-organizing-exact-mirror.md.
