/**
 * viable — Stafford Beer's VIABLE SYSTEM MODEL and the ALGEDONIC CHANNEL (frontier register §4): the
 * cybernetics-margin lens (Cybersyn, the VSM, syntegration).
 *
 * The unimplemented gem is the ALGEDONIC channel — a pain signal that BYPASSES the normal hierarchy and
 * reaches the apex (System 5) directly. In a polity whose ordinary routing follows the observer-category
 * translations, an algedonic alert from a distressed observer jumps straight to a designated apex in one
 * hop, skipping the intermediaries the chain of command would otherwise route through. It is the
 * structural antidote to a captured chain of command (the companion to `coagulationGuard`): when the
 * normal path is long or severed, the pain still gets through.
 *
 * VIABLE RECURSION is Beer's recursion theorem: every viable system is composed of viable systems and
 * embedded in one, and each level must satisfy Ashby's requisite variety to absorb its environment. A
 * recursion is viable iff every level is — variety absorbed at each layer.
 *
 * Reuses the observer-graph edges (`field.mts`) and `requisiteVariety` (`deciding.mts`).
