/**
 * persona — the mask/character/persona world of performance theory, read off the REAL ludics
 * (frontier register, Layer A continued). Persona is Latin for the actor's MASK; this module reads the
 * mask, the relation of mask to face, and the modes of wearing one, through Girard's operators.
 *
 *   MASK (Deleuze; Lévi-Strauss) = DELOCATION. A persona is a design worn at an address: `mask` relocates
 *   a design under a prefix (the same dialogical content, re-staged as a different character). Masks
 *   COMPOSE — `mask(mask(d))` is again a mask (delocation is a monoid action) — so there is no privileged
 *   "face" beneath: behind every mask, another mask (Deleuze, Difference and Repetition).
 *
 *   PERFORMATIVITY (Butler) — a theorem, not a slogan. Butler: there is no doer behind the deed; the
 *   appearance of a substantive self is an effect of the repeated performances. Ludics proves exactly
 *   this: "a design is the union of its chronicles" (Girard 2001 §4.7). `performativity` reconstructs the
 *   persona from its plays alone (`designChronicles` → `designFromActionSet`) and finds it FAITHFUL — the
 *   reconstruction equals the design. The deeds ARE the doer; there is no residual essence behind them.
 *
 *   PERSONA / SHADOW (Jung) = the stage split. The persona is the mask SHOWN — the incarnation, the front
 *   stage met by the audience; the shadow is the disowned — the ballast, the back stage no counter visits.
 *
 *   ROLE DISTANCE (Goffman) / identification vs demonstration (Stanislavski vs Brecht). An actor that
 *   equals its incarnation (MATERIAL — no reserve) IS the role: full identification, the Method. An actor
 *   that holds a large back-stage reserve SHOWS the role from a distance: Brecht's gestus / Verfremdung,
 *   Goffman's role distance — the self that exceeds the part it plays.
 *
 * Consumes `delocate`/`sameDesign` (delocation), `designChronicles`/`designFromActionSet` (the
 * union-of-chronicles theorem), and `stage` (the incarnation split); re-derives no ludics.
