/**
 * judging — socializing's JUDGMENT AGGREGATION: the discursive dilemma (the doctrinal paradox) and
 * its principled escape, the logical sibling of `preference.mts`'s Arrow/Condorcet escape.
 *
 * A collective of judges, each individually CONSISTENT, can aggregate to a COLLECTIVELY INCONSISTENT
 * judgment set: a court where a majority affirms each premise (p, q) yet a majority denies the legally
 * implied conclusion (r ⟺ p ∧ q). List–Pettit prove this is not a fluke — no aggregation rule
 * satisfies universal domain + collective rationality + systematicity + anonymity (the judgment-
 * aggregation impossibility, the logical analogue of Arrow). Premise-based and conclusion-based
 * aggregation genuinely diverge.
 *
 * The corpus escape is the SAME move that dissolved Condorcet (feedback: scale-2 ≠ scale-1; use a
 * hard layer-1 capability): aggregate each proposition along the bilattice KNOWLEDGE order ≤_k. A
 * proposition the judges SPLIT on settles to ⊤ (told-both — held paraconsistently) rather than being
 * forced to a truth value that manufactures collective inconsistency. RELAX collective rationality
 * (admit ⊤/incomplete judgment sets — Dietrich–List's exit) and the impossibility lifts: the bench
 * holds the contested premise open instead of pretending the court speaks with one incoherent voice.
 *
 * Consumes relating's bilattice value algebra (∨_k aggregation, the truth-order connectives ∧_t/∨_t);
 * re-authors none of it.
