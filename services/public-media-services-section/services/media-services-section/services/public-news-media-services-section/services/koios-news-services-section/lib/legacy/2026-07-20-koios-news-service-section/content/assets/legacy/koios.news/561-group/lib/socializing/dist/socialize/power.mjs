/**
 * power — socializing's VOTING-POWER indices: Banzhaf and Shapley–Shubik. A decision rule reports who
 * ALIGNED; power asks who was DECISIVE. In a weighted voting body the nominal weight is not the power:
 * a large bloc can be a dummy and a small bloc pivotal. For an agent collective this is the right way
 * to weight influence — and to catch a hidden dominator the degree-counting kyriarchy classifier in
 * `govern.mts` would miss (a member pivotal in every winning coalition is a κύριος by power, whatever
 * its nominal weight).
 *
 * Banzhaf (1965): a player's power ∝ the number of coalitions in which it SWINGS (its departure flips
 * a winning coalition to losing). Shapley–Shubik (1954): a player's power ∝ the fraction of join
 * orderings in which it is PIVOTAL (the member whose arrival crosses the quota). Both are computed by
 * exact enumeration over the 2ⁿ⁻¹ / n! structure — bounded to small bodies (the realistic case for a
 * council of agents).
