/**
 * writing/jupyter — organizing's IN-face standards codec: the Jupyter kernel
 * messaging protocol and the NOTEBOOK projected AS a witness ledger. The scale-2,
 * shared-compute (`computing`) half of the interior face: a stateful kernel an agent
 * drives, streaming outputs onto an append-only record.
 *
 * The thesis (protocols-as-faculty-projections.md): Jupyter is the wire-projection of
 * organizing's shared-compute math. The kernel = the OFFICE OF EXECUTION; a session =
 * active work; the NOTEBOOK = the witness ledger — cells are the append-only LOG,
 * kernel state is state, outputs are RECORDS, and the rendered `.ipynb` is content.
 * iopub broadcast (status/stream/execute_result) is the office's `broadcast` of what
 * it witnessed while executing.
 *
 * No second ontology (the gate): the messaging carriers are VIEWS of `jupyter.mts`'s
 * existing notebook carriers. An `execute_request` carries the SAME `source` a code
 * cell holds; an iopub `execute_result`/`stream` IS a `JupyterOutput` (jupyter.mts'
 * `JupyterOutputSchema`) wrapped in a message header; an `execute_reply` reports the
 * `execution_count` a code cell records and carries the outputs it broadcast. The
 * notebook this codec builds is `jupyter.mts`'s `JupyterNotebook` verbatim — the cells
 * ARE the log, so the log→records projection is a READING of the notebook, not a copy.
 *
 * The load-bearing brick (mirrors animating's RWIL `ledger.mts`): executing a sequence
 * of cells produces a notebook whose LOG (its code cells, in order) projects to RECORDS
 * (one record per cell: its execution_count, source, and the outputs it broadcast), and
 * that projection ROUND-TRIPS — `recordsToCells ∘ cellsToRecords = id` on the code-cell
 * log. An `execute_reply` carries exactly the outputs its cell's broadcast emitted.
 *
 * Layering: organizing → relating; reuses `../../jupyter.mjs` (organizing's own seed)
 * and only relating's root carrier kernel. Bare descent-path `$id`. See
 * dev/docs/notes/2026-06-25-jupyter-as-computing-in-face.md.
