/**
 * dramaturgy — the French stage/performance layer read off the REAL ludics, not proxies (frontier
 * register, Layer A: gaming/dev/docs/notes/2026-06-25-affect-and-dramaturgy-in-play.md).
 *
 * The ludic substrate already IS a theatre; this module names it through Girard's own operators:
 *
 *   FRONT STAGE / BACK STAGE (Goffman) = INCARNATION / design. Girard's incarnation |𝔇|_B
 *   (`incarnationOf`) is the material part of a design — the loci its plays against the behaviour's
 *   orthogonal B^⊥ actually VISIT. That is exactly the front stage: what the audience meets. The
 *   residual (committed but never visited — Girard's "ballast") is the back stage: prepared, unplayed,
 *   private. A design that equals its incarnation (`materialJudgment`) carries no back stage — the actor
 *   with nothing held in reserve.
 *
 *   THE PARADOX OF THE ACTOR (Diderot) — a theorem, not a metaphor. Diderot: the great actor feels
 *   nothing; the affect is manufactured in the audience by pure technique. In ludics a design is pure
 *   form and the affect (the convergence of the cut) is a property of the INTERACTION with the audience
 *   (B^⊥), never of the design alone. So two designs sharing a front stage (incarnation) are
 *   INDISTINGUISHABLE to the whole audience — identical orthogonality against every counter in B^⊥ —
 *   however different their back stages. The actor's interior is affectively inert; the affect lives in
 *   the cut. (This is also Massumi's autonomy of affect.)
 *
 *   THE SPECTATOR (Rancière) = the behaviour's orthogonal B^⊥. A design's meaning is its behaviour
 *   B = {𝔇}^⊥⊥ (`biorthogonalClosure`); the audience is its dual B^⊥ (`orthogonalOf`) — the horizon of
 *   counter-plays that give the performance sense. An EMANCIPATED spectator is a counter-design that
 *   itself bears a proponent move — it can step from watching into playing. SPECTACLE (Debord) is the
 *   degenerate audience that can only respond, never play: no member bears a positive action.
 *
 *   DISSENSUS (Rancière) = a newcomer whose admission CHANGES the bi-orthogonal closure — it
 *   redistributes which plays count. A newcomer already inside the closure is consensus: already counted.
 *
 * Consumes the genuine `incarnationOf` / `materialJudgment` / `orthogonal` / `biorthogonalClosure` /
 * `orthogonalOf` / `designActions`; re-derives no ludics.
