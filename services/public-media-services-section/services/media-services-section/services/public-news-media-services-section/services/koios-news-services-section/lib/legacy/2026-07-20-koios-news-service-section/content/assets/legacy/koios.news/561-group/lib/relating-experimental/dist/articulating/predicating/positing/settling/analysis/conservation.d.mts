/**
 * analysis/conservation — the boundary operator ∂ and the conservation law.
 *
 * Where the Laplacian L = ∂∂* is the symmetric second-order operator, this is
 * the first-order ∂ underneath it, which keeps the orientation L throws away: a
 * cell relates subject → object, value flows from subject into object. A FLOW is
 * a Rational per oriented edge (a 1-chain); its boundary ∂f is the net
 * accumulation per term (a 0-chain). ∂f = 0 everywhere is Kirchhoff's current
 * law / a circulation / ker ∂ / a conserved current. The syndrome names the
 * leaking term; an elided edge can be solved for. Generalized to any
 * GradedAdditive quantity (superselection by sector). Carrier-valued throughout.
