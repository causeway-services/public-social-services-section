/**
 * geometry/spatial/cut-and-project — 1-D cut-and-project schemes over ℤ².
 *
 * A scheme is an irrational quadratic slope α. A site (m,n) projects physically
 * to m + nα (the cut) and internally to its Galois conjugate m + nᾱ; an internal
 * window decides which sites are realized — acceptance is a judgment, not a hidden
 * filter. The accepted physical coordinates form a model set whose gap spectrum
 * is the aperiodic order the scheme produces.
