/**
 * Identity — the ludics copycat / Fax, the unit of the category of behaviours.
 *
 * Corpus / Girard 2001 "Locus Solum": the identity on a behaviour B is **Fax**, the
 * η-expanded **copycat** design — the B ⊸ B map that `cut`-composes to the identity
 * (`cut(Fax_B, d) ≃ d` for `d ∈ B`). Landing it is what turns behaviours from a mere
 * closure operator into a genuine **category** (objects = behaviours, composition =
 * `cut` in `proving/computational-ludics`, identity = Fax) — the gaming ROADMAP's
 * NEXT #1.
 *
 * A theory-honest note about the grain (this is a result, not a shortcut): the true
 * Fax is **reactive** — it copies whatever move the environment plays from one side of
 * its interface to the other. A reactive strategy is NOT expressible as a *static*
 * charge valuation (the `Design` grain of `ludicizing/design.mts`): a valuation fixes
 * its charges in advance, it cannot mirror an unknown counter-move. So the full
 * categorical identity lives at the **chronicle/action grain** (`chronicle.mts` carries
 * the action sequences), where copying-as-it-goes is expressible. What the flat
 * valuation grain DOES carry faithfully is the copycat's **convergence content**: the
 * canonical design that converges with (accepts) every member of a behaviour — its
 * universal counter-design, `faxResponder`, which lies in `B^⊥`. We build and witness
 * that here, and state the full identity law (with its grain) as `faxIdentity`.
