/**
 * settling/analysis/graded — a Rational carried in a superselection sector.
 *
 * A graded rational is an exact Rational under an opaque grade (the sector:
 * species, dimension, conserved-quantity type). Its one law is that addition is
 * defined only WITHIN a sector — you cannot add a charge to a spin. Scalar
 * multiplication by an ungraded Rational rescales within a sector; the graded
 * product pairs two sectors into a third (dimensional multiplication). The value
 * is always an exact carrier Rational; reading it out is a codec concern.
