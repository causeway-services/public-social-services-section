/**
 * predicating/bilattice-relation — four-valued relations as Chu-style matrices.
 *
 * A relation is a matrix of charge values over points × states, read with
 * witness/obstruction judgments. Point and state profiles are its rows and
 * columns; a state's extension is the points it charges present. `transpose`
 * swaps points and states; `dual` swaps and negates (the Chu involution). A
 * `RelationTransform` is an adjoint pair (forward on points, backward on states)
 * checked cell-by-cell; transforms compose and dualize. Self-contained over the
 * charge algebra and the exact `count`.
