/**
 * The exponential as a closure operator — $!$ corresponds to bi-orthogonal
 * closure.
 *
 * In the ludics/behaviour reading carried by `@emsenn/game-topology`, behaviours
 * are the bi-orthogonal (perp-perp) closures of design-sets and the exponential
 * $!$ is realized as the closure operator: $!$ is idempotent, increasing, and
 * monotone — the defining laws of a closure on the lattice of behaviours, exactly
 * those satisfied by `biorthogonalClosure`. The corpus locates replicable
 * resources at the $!$-comonad ("ILL: replicable resources added via the $!$
 * comonad"); on the game side, promotion under $!$ is settling a design-set to
 * its bi-orthogonal behaviour.
 *
 * This module carries that correspondence AS DATA plus a JSDoc theorem. It does
 * not invoke `biorthogonalClosure` (which needs designs and a universe); it
 * exposes the named statement and `exponentialClosesTo`, a conceptual reference
 * to game-topology's closure, so downstream code can cite the identity without
 * recomputing it. Reduce/reuse/recycle: the closure already lives in
 * game-topology; we name it, we do not reimplement it.
