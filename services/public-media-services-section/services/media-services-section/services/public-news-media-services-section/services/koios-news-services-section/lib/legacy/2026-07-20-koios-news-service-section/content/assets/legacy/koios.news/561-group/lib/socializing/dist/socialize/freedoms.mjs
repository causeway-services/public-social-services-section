/**
 * freedoms — Graeber & Wengrow's THREE PRIMORDIAL FREEDOMS (The Dawn of Everything, 2021), the
 * marginal anthropology-of-freedom lens that supplies the package's normative spine (frontier register §2).
 *
 * Freedom, on their account, is not abstract but three concrete capacities: the freedom to LEAVE, the
 * freedom to DISOBEY, and the freedom to REORGANIZE the terms of association. Each is already a primitive
 * in the package — `secede` (leave), `refuse` (disobey), constitutional self-amendment (reorganize). This
 * module makes the COMPLETENESS reading explicit: a polity is free iff all three remain callable. And it
 * states californication precisely against that bar — the regime that keeps all three STRUCTURALLY
 * callable while the affective register forecloses the desire to call them, so the polity reads as free
 * by every structural test and is nonetheless unfree.
 *
 * A pure reading over three boolean capacities (computed by the caller from `secede`/`foreclosureWatch`,
 * `refuse`-admissibility, and the presence of constitutional-level acts) plus the affective
 * `recuperated` flag (from `affectiveRecuperationIndex`).
 */
/**
 * threeFreedoms — read a polity's freedom as the conjunction of the three primordial freedoms (leave,
 * disobey, reorganize), and cross-check against the affective register: a structurally-free polity whose
 * contestation is being recuperated (the `recuperated` flag, from `affectiveRecuperationIndex`) is
 * californicated, not free. This is the normative spine the californication argument leans on: free ⟺
 * all three callable AND the desire to use them not foreclosed.
