/**
 * ostrom — socializing's OSTROM capabilities: the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD)
 * rule-grid, the eight design principles for enduring commons governance, graduated sanctions, and
 * polycentric nesting. Elinor Ostrom's empirical findings on how communities self-govern shared
 * resources WITHOUT a kyriarchist sovereign — the most directly applicable mode for organizing a
 * commons of agentic labor (a shared pool of work an agent swarm draws on and replenishes).
 *
 * Grounded in content/_archive .../what-is-the-theory-of-governance.md (the Ostrom-IAD 7×3 grid and
 * the eight design principles; polycentric governance survey). These consume relating's COMPLEX
 * MATH rather than re-deriving it:
 *   - graduated sanctions are a monotone DESCENT in the bilattice TRUTH ORDER ≤_t (relating's
 *     `meetTruthValue`): each violation lowers the offender's standing toward f (removal), the
 *     escalation Ostrom's principle 5 prescribes over a binary punish/not.
 *   - polycentricity is read through the graph LAPLACIAN (socializing's `spectralConsensus`:
 *     Matrix-Tree spanning-tree robustness + H⁰ cluster count) and the network-sheaf H¹
 *     (`sheafCharges`): nested enterprises cohere when the centers glue (H¹=0) yet stay plural
 *     and redundantly connected (robust).
