/**
 * analysis/differential — measuring a subject against a CONTROL object.
 *
 * A control is a catalog of norms a reference object satisfies; measuring a
 * subject against it reads, per norm, a bilattice CHARGE (not pass/fail):
 * potential = the norm holds, active = a divergence, stable = a divergence held
 * under a declared allowance (contested), absurd = no evidence. The control is
 * descriptive, not coercive — the reading is the *difference* from the control,
 * valued in charges. Generalized over an opaque scope.
