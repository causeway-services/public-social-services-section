/**
 * opinion — socializing's OPINION DYNAMICS: DeGroot averaging and the Friedkin–Johnsen model with
 * stubborn agents. Where `consensus.mts`/`face.mts` read WHETHER fixed opinions glue, this models HOW
 * they evolve and whether they converge at all. The package already computes the social graph's
 * Laplacian (`spectralConsensus`); opinion dynamics is the heat flow ON that graph.
 *
 * DeGroot (1974): xₜ₊₁ = W xₜ over a row-stochastic trust matrix W — repeated averaging drives a
 * connected, aperiodic society to consensus (the dominant left eigenvector weighting). Friedkin–
 * Johnsen (1990): xᵢ,ₜ₊₁ = λᵢ Σⱼ Wᵢⱼ xⱼ,ₜ + (1−λᵢ) sᵢ — each agent is pulled toward the social
 * average with susceptibility λᵢ but anchored to its innate opinion sᵢ with stubbornness (1−λᵢ). The
 * crucial empirical fact: with any stubborn agents (λᵢ < 1) holding different innate opinions, the
 * society reaches a PERSISTENT-DISAGREEMENT equilibrium, not consensus — the formal signature of
 * polarization and echo chambers. The observed contraction rate is governed by the graph's algebraic
 * connectivity (the Fiedler value); we report the empirical rate rather than an eigensolve.
